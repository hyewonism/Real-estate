# Real-estate

## Overview
```sh
This website is envisioned for use by multiple real estate agents scattered across various branches of the company.
Agents can upload their individual property listings and also share listings of other registered colleagues within the company.
Agents can respond to inquiries about properties in other areas and prevent customer leakage to other companies.
The company owner can access reports, checking transaction rates and price trends on a monthly or quarterly basis for different branches.
```

## Development
```sh
This repository was initially created as a self-development page for HTML coding practice.
However, there are plans to further enhance it by developing backend code and improving the UI environment.
For the backend, Flask and MySQL will be used to store and update real estate listings and transaction information.
On the UI side, React will be employed to enhance the user experience.
